# Covid_Vaccination_Record_System
In this period of Covid-19, we are facing many difficulties in our day today life. One of the major issue which can beat this situation is vaccine for this deadly virus, but since in the country like India, vaccinating this huge population is huge challenge for government of India. Government if India have launched a site www.cowin.gov.in for helping people get vaccinated without any rush. My program is a offline version of that site to keep record of college students who have got vaccinated and who is left to get vaccinated.
